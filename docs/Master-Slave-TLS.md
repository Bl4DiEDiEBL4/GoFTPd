# Master-Slave Authentication

WeaveFTPd authenticates every slave control connection. Choose one of these
methods before starting or upgrading a master/slave deployment:

1. mTLS (recommended): the master verifies a CA-signed client certificate and
   requires its Common Name to match `slave.name` exactly.
2. Per-slave IP masks: when mTLS is disabled, the connecting address must match
   a mask registered for the claimed slave name.

A slave with neither a valid client certificate nor a matching mask is refused.
The global `master.slave_allowlist` and denylist remain additional network
filters; they do not replace per-slave authentication.

## mTLS Setup

On the master, generate a CA and a server certificate. Include every hostname
or IP address that slaves use for `slave.master_host` when prompted:

```bash
./setup.sh certs "My Site"
./setup.sh slavecert SLAVE1
./setup.sh slavecert SLAVE2
```

Configure the master:

```yaml
master:
  slave_ca_cert: "./etc/certs/ca.crt"
```

For each slave, securely copy the master's `ca.crt` as `master-ca.crt`, plus
only that slave's certificate and private key. Using a separate filename avoids
overwriting a CA that the slave may use for its own client-facing data TLS
certificate. Configure paths under its `slave:` block:

```yaml
slave:
  name: "SLAVE1"
  master_host: "master.example.net"
  master_ca_cert: "./etc/certs/master-ca.crt"
  client_cert: "./etc/certs/slave-SLAVE1.crt"
  client_key: "./etc/certs/slave-SLAVE1.key"
```

The server certificate must contain `master.example.net` in its Subject
Alternative Name. The client certificate CN must equal `SLAVE1`. Do not share
one client certificate between slaves.

Changing `master.slave_ca_cert` or replacing its CA file requires a master restart. `SITE REHASH` can
reload mask files and other slave policy, but cannot replace authentication on
an already-running TLS listener.

## IP Mask Setup

Leave `master.slave_ca_cert`, `slave.master_ca_cert`, `slave.client_cert`, and
`slave.client_key` empty. Then register every slave on the master:

```text
SITE SLAVE SLAVE1 ADDMASK 203.0.113.10/32
SITE SLAVE SLAVE2 ADDMASK 2001:db8:10::/64
SITE SLAVE SLAVE1 MASKS
SITE SLAVE MASKS
```

Bare IPv4/IPv6 addresses, CIDR blocks, and IPv4 wildcard masks such as
`203.0.113.*` are accepted. Masks are persisted in
`master.slave_masks_file`, defaulting to `etc/slave_masks.txt`.

You can seed masks in the master config on first startup:

```yaml
slaves:
  - name: "SLAVE1"
    masks: ["203.0.113.10/32"]
```

After that slave name has persisted masks, `SITE SLAVE ... ADDMASK/DELMASK` is
authoritative and later config changes do not overwrite them.

## TLS Verification Boundaries

TLS encryption and certificate verification are separate protections. An
`insecure` setting still encrypts traffic, but it accepts any certificate and
therefore does not authenticate the remote peer.

- Sitebot defaults to `irc.tls_verify: strict`. Use `custom` and
  `irc.tls_ca_cert` for a private IRC CA. `insecure` remains available as an
  explicit compatibility setting, with a startup warning.
- A slave with `slave.master_ca_cert` verifies the master's certificate. If it
  is empty, the legacy IP-mask setup still encrypts the control connection but
  does not authenticate the master. An IP mask only authenticates the slave to
  the master; it is not a replacement for master certificate verification.
- Active/SSCN `PROT P` FXP and slave-to-slave outbound data connections use a
  compatibility TLS client that does not verify a peer certificate. Those data
  channels are encrypted but not certificate-authenticated. Keep FXP peers
  trusted and use mTLS for the independent master/slave control link.

WeaveFTPd intentionally keeps these compatibility modes for existing sites.
New deployments should use strict/custom verification for IRC and mTLS for
master/slave control connections.

## Upgrade Checklist

Before restarting an existing deployment with this version:

- configure mTLS on the master and every slave, or add a mask for every slave;
- add `SLAVE` to the siteop `sitecmd` allow rule in an existing custom
  `etc/permissions.yml` before using the new SITE commands;
- make sure mTLS server certificate SANs match each `slave.master_host` value;
- restart the master after changing `master.slave_ca_cert`;
- set sitebot `irc.tls_verify` to `strict`, `custom`, or explicitly `insecure`.

You can seed masks before the new daemon is running by creating
`etc/slave_masks.txt` manually:

```text
SLAVE1 203.0.113.10/32
SLAVE2 2001:db8:10::/64
```

Sitebot now verifies IRC TLS certificates by default. Use `custom` plus
`irc.tls_ca_cert` for a private IRC CA. `insecure` preserves the old behavior
but does not authenticate the IRC server; it still encrypts the IRC connection.
